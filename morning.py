    1. The money on your credit card is not your money, but the bank's money so it isn't free.
    When you use your Credit Card to make purchases, the bank is letting you borrow some amount of money to spend
    that must be paid back eventually. After the 21 day grace period, the longer it takes you to pay back the balance,
    the balance, the more the interest will add up.

    2. There's a limit to HOW MUCH you can purchase on your credit card.
    It is known as a credit limit ($500 in your case) and is the maximum amount of money you can borrow at a time from 
    the bank. Keeping a low credit card balance makes it easier to pay off and build a better credit history.

    3. You're being graded.
    Everybody who uses a credit card has a credit score which is based on your credit card history (how frequently you 
    make payments, outstanding loans, your available credit etc.) It ranges on average from 300 to 850, with higher
    credit scores being better. 
    Having a good credit score gives you benefits such as approval for loans in the future for a mortgage for a new house
    or buying a new car, better interest rates on your loans and more."""'\n')
